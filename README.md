# **Visual Calculator**

## **Description**  
Visual Calculator is my first project created to learn Swift and get hands-on experience with Xcode's **Storyboard**. Itâ€™s a simple yet functional calculator application with basic arithmetic operations and additional features like clearing the input and toggling the sign of a number. This project marks the beginning of my journey in iOS app development, focusing on the fundamentals of working with Swift, UI design, and app logic.

## **Features**  
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Modulus (%).  
- **Sign Toggle (+/-)**: Change the sign of the entered number.  
- **Clear Input (C)**: Reset the calculator to its initial state.  
- **Live Display**: Updates the result or input dynamically in the calculator screen.  
- Simple and intuitive user interface built using **Storyboard**.

## **Learning Objectives**  
- Understand the basics of **Swift** programming.  
- Learn how to design UI using **Xcode's Storyboard**.  
- Work with `IBAction` and `IBOutlet` to connect UI elements with code.  
- Implement basic app logic and manage app states effectively.  
- Debug and test applications directly on an iPhone using Xcode.
